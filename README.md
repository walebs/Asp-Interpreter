# Background

An Asp-interpreter made by me and a friend in Java. It was a project connected to "IN2030-Project in programming" in the University of Oslo.

# Execution

To execute the interpreter, you have to write "ant" in the terminal inside the repo and then use:

  Java -jar asp.jar 'filename'

# Afterthought

We wish we had cleaned up more code but was time cramped.
